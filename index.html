title: TSP Algorithm Selection

<h1>TSP Algorithm Selection</h1>
<p>The <b>Travelling Salesperson Problem</b> (TSP) is arguably the most prominent NP-hard combinatorial optimisation problem. Given a set of n cities and pairwise distances between those, the objective in the TSP is to find the shortest round-trip or tour through all cities, i.e., a sequence in which every city is visited exactly once, the start and end cities are identical, and the total length of the tour is minimal. The Euclidean TSP has important applications, e.g., in the fabrication of printed circuit boards as well as in transportation and logistics. We aim at constructing an instance-based algorithm selection model in order to improve the current state-of-the-art solver.</p>
